This page presents an animated neon text effect with the message
“Hello World, This Is My First Project.”

The design is inspired by cyberpunk and futuristic neon styles.
The text glows with bright cyan light and uses multiple visual effects such as:

Neon glow animation that smoothly pulses over time
Flicker effect that simulates a real neon sign
Glitch distortion that adds a digital, cyber-style feeling
Fade-in transition when the text appears on the screen
Mouse movement interaction that creates a parallax effect

The background uses a dark gradient to enhance the brightness and contrast of the neon text.
All animations are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without external libraries.

This project demonstrates the use of:

CSS keyframe animations
Text shadow and glow effects
JavaScript for smooth transitions and interactivity
Modern web design techniques for visual impact

Overall, this page is a simple but stylish introduction project that combines animation, interaction, and futuristic design in a single screen experience.
